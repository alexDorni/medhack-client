        The vaccine is a safe and intelligent way to produce an immune response in the body, without causing the
        disease.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is a biological preparation that contains killed or attenuated microorganisms, or their fragments.
        Following the administration of the vaccine, an immune response occurs, which protects us against the disease.

        Vaccination was introduced by Edward Jenner, an English physician who, in 1796, performed the first immunization against smallpox.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Today, vaccination saves more than three million lives worldwide annually, according to World Health Organization (WHO). 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    When vaccination coverage is high, the number of people contacting the disease is reduced considerably.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    One of the most important results of vaccination was the eradication of smallpox. The last case of natural smallpox was recorded in Somalia in 1977, according to the WHO.

    Vaccines are safer and more effective than the vast majority of medicinal products, and their production is carefully controlled.

    Although rare, vaccination contraindications must be respected, according to medical indications:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Severely immunocompromised persons generally should not receive live vaccines.
        </li>
        <li>
        Persons who experienced encephalopathy within 7 days after administration of a previous dose of pertussis-containing vaccine not attributable to another identifiable cause should not receive additional doses of a vaccine that contains pertussis.
        </li>
        <li>
        Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) disease is a contraindication to the receipt of rotavirus vaccines.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    When you are vaccinated, your immune system will respond as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Recognizes invading germs, such as viruses or bacteria
        </li>
        <li>
        Produces antibodies. Antibodies are proteins produced naturally by the immune system that "fight" the virus or bacteria and prevent the disease from developing 
        </li>
        <li>
        Keeps the memory of the pathogen - it "remembers" the antigen and how it can fight against it. If you are exposed to that germ in the future, your immune system can quickly destroy it before the disease appears
        </li>
    </ul>
